# Project Plan: Custom Agentic AI System Using OpenRouter DeepSeek-R1

## Objective

Develop a web-based agentic AI system leveraging the OpenRouter "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b:free" model. The system will enable users to perform complex tasks through structured, step-by-step processes, manage multiple tasks and sessions, and maintain context across API calls. All data, including chat history, will be stored client-side, allowing users to run the application locally after cloning the repository.

## System Architecture

### Core Functionality
- **User Input:** Accept user prompts and generate step-by-step plans using DeepSeek-R1.
- **Task Execution:** Execute tasks sequentially, maintaining context by passing previous step outputs to subsequent steps.
- **System Prompts:** Utilize precise system prompts for each step to ensure high-quality outputs.
- **Final Output:** Compile results from all steps into a cohesive final output.
- **Internet Access:** Implement mechanisms for the model to access the internet when required.

### User Interface (UI)
- **Left Panel:** Manage chat sessions (create, delete, rename).
- **Main View:** Display task progress, including the number of tasks, current task status, and ongoing task details.
- **Top Center:** Input field for users to enter their OpenRouter API key.
- **Interaction:** Allow users to input additional prompts in the same chat window for further tasks related to the project.

### Data Management
- **Client-Side Database:** Store all chat history and session data locally, ensuring privacy and ease of use for users running the application from a cloned repository.

## Project Phases

### 1. Planning
- Define project scope, architecture, and UI/UX design.
- Break down the project into manageable components and tasks.

### 2. Design
- Create wireframes for the UI.
- Draft system prompts for each step of task execution.

### 3. Implementation
- Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a suitable framework).
- Implement backend logic for API calls, context management, and local database integration.
- Integrate the DeepSeek-R1 model for task processing.

### 4. Testing
- Test individual components and the overall system.
- Validate the accuracy of task execution and context continuity.

### 5. Deployment
- Provide clear instructions for cloning and running the application locally.
- Include user documentation and guides.

## Deliverables

- **Requirements Document:** Detailed description of system features and user stories.
- **Feature List:** Comprehensive breakdown of all functionalities.
- **Component List:** UI and logic components with responsibilities.
- **Wireframes:** Visual representations of the user interface.
- **System Prompts:** Templates for guiding the AI model at each step.
- **Source Code:** Complete implementation of frontend, backend logic, and local database integration.
- **Testing Suite:** Scripts and documentation for validating system functionality.
- **User Documentation:** Guides for setup, usage, and troubleshooting.
